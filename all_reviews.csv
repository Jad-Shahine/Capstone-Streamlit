≈ûeymanur Y√∂nt,"We have spent a Saturday evening there, and the vibe was amazing. First of all, service is really good, and staff is friendly. Yeran was so helpful, she explained us all the food, and answered our questions sincerely.

The place was clean, and they serve food and alcohol.

We have tried kibbeh, chicken w tahini, fatata harra, and moutabal. Chicken with tahini was really original and tasty. Cocktails were tasty as well.

The night ended with a DJ playing Arabic songs. All the people there were dancing and it was lovely to be part of it!

I could not recommend there enough to anyone who visits Beirut!",1.0

Burcu Filiz,"It's a cute little place with great food, 3 mezzas + 1 Armenian kebbeh + 1/4 arak costs around 25‚Ç¨ which is very good compared to the taste. The music can be a bit loud, just be aware of that and you'll have a great time.",1.0

Hanine Abdel Rahman,"I Love the ambiance and was waiting for the opportunity to try their lunch.
The waiters are so helpful and discrete. We were welcomed by a bread basket and a cup of debs remman as we requested!
We ordered:
-their exquisite fattoush: not to be missed with the tastiest dressing
- The Zaalouk: our all time addiction. for those who never tired it, a must: it is a Moroccan mezza of eggplants, pepper and tomatoes perfectly blended
- Chicken and lemon tajine with a side of couscous: with lots of caramelized onions and delicious Moroccan seasoning

If you have not visited them yet you should!

One of  my previous experiences is detailed below

I love everything about this place, day or night it has this addictive thing that keeps u wana come back. Food with high quality, tasty and very well presented.

Lewis Tullett,Wow what delicious food! Go for the Armenian options like the kibbe and fatteh. Reasonable prices but the quality and freshness is unmatched locally. Must visit. Also so nice to have clean air without smokers inside.,1.0
May Shigenobu,"The food here very clean and delicious. The food menu is from all this region (Lebanese, Armenian, North African).
You can experience the fun and Lebanese nightlife here on weekends. Restaurant turns into a dance atmosphere after 9:30pm.
On Thursdays, they have a live band event.
On Friday and Saturday they have a DJ dance atmosphere after 9:00 pm.
So if you are going on these days it's better to reserve a table for dinner early and stay for the events.",1.0

A must try.",1.0
Abu Marwan,"Mezyan used to be one of favorite resturant in Hamra . Good location , good service , friendly staff. In my recent visit on September 29th , I saw major deterioration in the service by waiters and waitresses , and even not friendly atmosphere. Gone the time of good services of Aisha and her colleagues. The food too is below average in one of their significant dish , Kuskos .
The administration of the restaurant need to have a serious look to the day to day functioning of the restaurant",0.0
John Qattar,"Lunch here is a calm and pleasant experience. The restaurant's modest entrance belies a vast interior, bit like the tardis in the Dr Who tv series.
This is not just another cookie-cutter Lebanese restaurant. Plenty of different dishes to try. Aside from the dish of the day, recommend the roasted peppers with delicious feta cheese topping and the Moroccan Kofte balls in tomato sauce.
Oh, they have draught Beirut 961 IPA, a pint of which was served chilled.
For the money, a well-deserved 5 stars.",1.0
AB BC,First started coming here in early 2016 and thankfully it has managed to survive with almost exactly the same menu since then and kept its friendly (though overworked) service. The only thing that has changed is the atmosphere and the crowd it attracts - so many people have left Beirut or are struggling that it's very much a place for those who can afford their prices. I believe it has some of the best food I've ever had anywhere - and will always come here  :),1.0

Aur Ghs,"Located in Hamra steet, the place offers lebanese food and some other middle eastern food.
We ordered: the moroccan kafta, hommos, fries, cheese rkakat, fatouch and a bottle of water for 92 000 LBP.
The service was fast, the food delicious and good portions for two people.
They have an outdoor seating as well.
The ambiance is oriental music, expect umm kalthoum, fairuz and others.
Super recommended.",1.0
Lama ghandour,used to be my favorite place. they increased the prices insanely and decreased their quality of food. ur supposed to do either of them. I dnt recommend it. but maybe it is still nice for thursday and friday parties.,0.0
Hachem Hassan,"I was urged to try the place for the food quality
The place is cozy and amazing staff
Friendly and fast service
Good presentation is good
Just most of the food was sour
I know it's more lebanese Armenian food and they need to use summak plus mulases
But still I find it so sour
I tried most of the mezza
Msakhan, chicken liver, sausages, kibbe armenian, sou boerek, Manti and kebab with cheery
The Manti was the best.. but again was sour ...
The cherry kebab was so dry and the  meat didn't taste that good",0.0

Roy Ha,"Mezyan never disappoints! I've always enjoyed dinning and winning there. The staff is friendly the owner even more. Food is just perfect. The moutabls are pure taste. The salads are fresh and the seasoning are well balanced. The meats tastes great, although I would have appreciated just a tad less pomegranate molasses on them. The mouajanat are crispy and tasteful. The kebbe both 2ras and the Armenian ones are to die for. Good selection of beer on tap and a homemade Arak option is available. Prices are incredible affordable while quality remains high! Highly recommended :-) they also have a small dance floor after 11.",1.0
Fabian Sck,"We absolutely loved the place. It was very busy when we arrived so make sure to book a table in advance.

We ordered the lamb and the chicken tagine. While the chicken tagine was a bit too sweet for my taste, my wife loved it. The lamb was delicious! And a lot of meat so come hungry. We both chose the cuscus as a side which was very good.

We sat at the bar and had a great conversation with waiters and barkeepers. Super friendly there.

Also live music was played.",1.0
yasar adanali,"The place has a split personality. Until midnight, it serves delicious food and nice cocktails with a cosy ambiance. Then music and increased level of alcohol in blood take control and people start dancing everywhere, including on top of tables :) Love it",1.0
Lama N,Tried mezyan on thursday night while enjoying safi reslan and his amazing voice. We tried their : fattoush. Halloumi rocca . Mohammara . Hommos. Cheese rolls .

Rajaa Gacem van Moorsel,"While on holiday in Lebanon we have been recommended to go to Mezyan and it became our favorite place ! It was by far the place with the best food in Beirut, the best service ever and the vibes are incredible when they have live music ! The people working there are super nice, special  thanks to Yeran who went the extra mile and managed to find us a corner while the place was fully booked on my last day in Beirut. We really appreciated and it made our last night memorable! If you want to have the best time while in Beirut, I  would really recommend going to Mezyan !",1.0
Zeinab Dirani,"The place by itself is nice and cozy. The menu is very limited and the chicken does not taste good. The mezza is acceptable but it can be better in terms of quality. The portions are big and the service is fast.
Recommended if you want a nice atmosphere but not really if you want delicious food. Price is good",0.0

Jimmy NADER,"A truly joyful nightlife experience, with delicious Lebanese food in a middle-eastern vintage-kitch ambiance, and when after 11h pm the DJ kicks-in, the people start to party and dance until the late night. A highly recommended experience if you're either a visitor or a local.

(Note: I visited this place 2 years ago. Not sure about its status now after the pandemic and the economic crisis.)",1.0

Highly recommend for lebanese cuisine",1.0
Kv Duong,This place is simply fantastic! I only wish the rest of Beirut was like this. Very tasty food with a wide menu of Lebanese/ Moroccan/ Armenian food (don't let this put you off. We went back 3 nights in a row and tried the majority of their menu). Low key efficient and friendly service. Great to see both locals and tourists here - ie a place that is actually priced for the locals as well!,1.0
Carolina Pompilio,"Love this place, especially with the live music and dancing people",1.0
Mehlad,"The place is very cosy and original in it's interior design. The atmosphere is so relaxed and suitable for quality time with either yourself or with your pals; and it's even romantic given the dim lighting. Food and beverages are reasonably priced given the good quality and the portions, also the menu is diverse. The best part for me was how at 11 pm the place transforms from a restaurant into a night club. I recommend this place for anyone who's interested in Lebanon's nightlife!",1.0
Philippe Elia,"A nice place im Hamra's Main street. Food is nicely served and is delicious. Service is good and staff are nice. The menu is really rich and interesting. Alcohol is also great.
At around midnight, the place ""transforms"" into a club. Music is weird yet very fun. Environment though becomes a little bit messy for a small place where tables become the dancing floor themselves.",0.0

Ziad Zeytoun,"Very good traditional Lebanese food.
Not expensive, given its location in Hamra.
Personally I prefer the place to be more quiet, but other than that, everything is great.
Hosts live music, but I haven't attended any of their events yet.
Overall, I think Mezyan offers a good experience.",1.0
Mohamad Sabbah,Very fun place! It has interesting food. You should definitely try Itch and the Arak. On weekend nights the place turns into a party and during the day it's pretty calm. Must try place!,1.0
Charlotte PARIS,"Great setting (don't pay to much attention to the fact that you have to enter through a commercial lobby) Good cocktails - there are better ones in Beirut but usually in specialist bars so by that standard they are doing pretty well. The terrace outside is very nice, there is a good choice of dishes and everything we tried was very tasty. Service can be a bit long and forget a thing of two here and there but the place is very alive with a nice crowd and makes this one of the best spot in Hamra. Once to visit and visit again. I hear late at the weekend there is also some dancing there.",1.0
Paul Attenborough,"Casual dining with a local menu, and excellent too, both food and value, beer (I haven't tried anything else!), wine spirits.

Necrostate,"One of my favourite restaurants in Lebanon in terms of food. 3 stars for their indoor smoking policy which is a big deal breaker to me and many people I know. (Open indoor smoking as of 7-8 pm, as for the other times, people can smoke in the corners, which is not as bad, but still bad.. it's the same air.. smoking and food don't mix)",0.0

Ali Daher,Good food. Great mood inside. ,1.0
erica b,"Really bad service. First they cheated us with happy hour drinks by telling us that there are 'exceptions' after we ordered drinks that according to the notice board, should be in happy hour price. We ordered lamb tagine and they gave us beef tagine. Two people recognised it as beef and the waiter was trying to convince us that it is lamb because they know their meat source.  Horrible. Never again.",0.0

Aya Refaat,"Mezyan is one of the nicest places in Hamra.

Food is great, specially ""mezzat"" like hot potato, itch and dolma. People are friendly, they help you to make a choice if you are confused about what to eat and drink.

Food quality is really good, prices are okay, as you all know lebanon is a very expensive country specially Beirut. This is a restaurant in one of the most famous streets of Beirut, so it can't be cheap, but honestly compared to other places, their prices are okay, you can pay btw 10$ to 15$ for a nice dinner and a beer (no meet).

They have both indoor and a small outdoor areas, but personally I prefer the terrace tables, as after 8pm the place gets so crowded specially during weekends.

The only drawback is that you have to be there before 8 pm, the best timing is between (5:30 pm to 7pm), as if you go later I can't guarantee you to find a table.
After 11 pm the place becomes overcrowded and noisy, people get drunk and start dancing and singing out loudly, which I don't like and I find so annoying, but if you like partying, you would love the place.",1.0
Tariq Keblaoui,"Going to start off by saying most people like this place, but every time I've come here I get the same experience.

Being glared at by the man in the fedora hat who owns the place (with an instance of him refusing me a table once while the place was empty for no explained reason) and the classic and consistent food poisoning every-time I order a tabouleh/fattoush or sausage.",0.0

Sherine ElZein,"Mediterranean fusion restaurant nested on one of Hamra's alleyways. Love their eggplant fatteh, it is to die for ! Everything on the menu is good and the ambience is genuinely fun ! It is not a posh/showy spot, it is more on the neo leftist side of things, just like the Hamra neighbourhood used to be and it is what I love about this place.

Batata hara, eggplant fatte, Armenian stuffed meatballs (kƒ±bbe), taboule (sallata with lots of greenery) were all delicious. Definitely recommended. It was also nice to come across the DJ performance on Friday and Saturday. We had our fill of local music.",1.0
Deniz Miray A.,"You should definitely come to Beirut and eat at Mezyan! üòç We had lunch at Mezyan, as I read a lot in blogs and recommended by a friend from Beirut. If I were to list all the restaurants I've tried in Beirut, Mezyan would definitely be at the top üëçüèº

üëâüèºHummus: It was definitely the best hummus I had in Beirut. Of course 10/10.
üëâüèºKibbe: The stuffed meatballs were very successful. 10/10
üëâüèºTahina Chicken: Tahini chicken dish - I didn't think tahini sauce could go so well with chicken, it was very successful. 9/10
üëâüèºBatata Harra: The potatoes were cooked in a slightly spicy sauce - it was amazing. 10/10

ü§ìWe also liked that it was quiet at lunch. By the way, when you look for Mezyan on the street, you do not come across him directly, you enter through the passage.
üé∂My friend from Beirut also said that there is musical entertainment in the evenings on weekends, we did not attend but it was very entertaining.",1.0
Carine Lahoud,"The experience was beyond my expectations
Cool and cozy place with Arabic live music band I have danced all night long it was a night to remember with my beautiful friends we wear like 9 people its almost 30$ per person food and drinks

You have to try this place I really recommend",1.0
Fatma Nese Kok,"It is better to go by making a reservation, the food is good, the place is nice. Two dishes were particularly good, one was Makdous, made with pickled eggplant. It may not appeal to everyone, for those who like things like fried pickles. Barkouk tagine, lamb with prunes, was delicious. A very sweet lady who spoke Turkish looked after our table and helped us choose. It is at the bottom of a place like a passage, we would never have found it ourselves by wandering around the street if our guide had not guided us. I recommend it to everyone.",1.0
Justyna,"Very tasty food, the place is a bit hidden, but has its own charm. The only thing I didn't like was the squid - it looked like something from a Lidl package, but the interior was very nice, so I don't detract from the rating.",1.0
tahsin akpƒ±nar,"We liked it very much. Raki glasses are as big as lemonade glasses. The appetizers have the same/similar names as ours, but they taste amazing!! The waiters are very friendly and positive. There is even a friend who speaks Turkish. I definitely recommend it.",1.0
Josip Broz Tito,"An Armenian waitress took care of us. He spoke Turkish very well. We ordered 5 pieces of appetizers, but we couldn't finish them. I didn't have the chance to try kunefe. The portions of the food are large and delicious. We ordered sausage, stuffed meatballs, hummus, potato batata harra and salad. A glass of raki, a glass of wine. It cost around $35. I think it's a normal number. Only the entrance is in a passage. Those who go there need to be a little careful. I found it by searching privately. Otherwise you won't find it.",1.0

Adolfo,"Armenian restaurant in the heart of Hamra in Beirut. The place is very nice and the dishes are delicious. Personally, I recommend taking various tastings of the so-called mezza, i.e. small tastings. This way you can try many different flavors. The baba ganousche is excellent",1.0
Adnan Altaleb,"A special place for gatherings of friends, parties and dancing

Isabelle Jourdan,"Tasty and generous cuisine in a very warm and friendly setting. Relaxed atmosphere and a smiling and cordial welcome which allowed us to discover delicious Armenian cuisine at very affordable prices. A very small downside: the noise level of conversations quickly becomes overwhelming. But a real plus, no hookah smoke, but perfect value for money. We will return there by sitting on the pretty little terrace at the back to enjoy the peace and quiet. To recommend without hesitation, which is rare in Beirut at the moment",1.0

We went to eat, we asked for room for two people, they wanted to sit one on a coffee table the size of a tiny serving plate. When we asked how we would eat here, we got the answer that everyone eats here. They have positioned themselves as a place for intellectuals, and they charge undeserved prices just for the ambiance (since expats go there). Stuffed vine leaves and hummus taste bad enough to make you think they came from cans.",0.0

My vote is linked to the unjustified refusal to accept the $100 bill that we paid, we were treated by thieves who present fake money, for a self-respecting establishment a pen or a machine was enough to verify the banknote rather than doing and having it done the demmerda figure in front of everyone.

üëâüèºHummus: It was definitely the top hummus I had in Beirut. Of course 10/10.
üëâüèºKibbe: The stuffed meatballs were very successful. 10/10
üëâüèºTahina Chicken: Tahini chicken dish - I didn't think tahini sauce could go so well with chicken, it was very successful. 9/10
üëâüèºBatata Harra: The potatoes were cooked in a slightly spicy sauce - it was incredible. 10/10

ü§ìWe also liked that it was quiet at lunch. By the way, when you look for Mezyan on the street, you do not come across him directly, you enter through the passage.

The waiters are so helpful and discrete. We were welcomed by a bread basket and a cup of debs remman as we requested!
We ordered:
-their exquisite fattoush: not to be missed with the tastiest dressing
- The Zaalouk: our all time addiction. for those who never tired it, a must: it is a Moroccan mezza of eggplants, pepper and tomatoes flawlessly blended
- Chicken and lemon tajine with a side of couscous: with lots of caramelized onions and scrumptious Moroccan seasoning

If you have not visited them yet you should!

The portions of the food are large and exceptionally delectable. We ordered sausage, stuffed meatballs, hummus, potato batata harra and salad. A glass of raki, a glass of wine. It cost around $35. I think it's a normal number. Only the entrance is in a passage. Those who go there need to be a little careful. I found it by searching privately. Otherwise you won't find it.",1.0

zeina sabbagh,"Mezyan is one of the delightfulst places in Hamra.

Food is exceedingly good quality, specially ""mezzat"" like hot potato, itch and dolma. People are friendly, they help you to make a choice if you are confused about what to eat and drink.

Food quality is really good quality, prices are okay, as you all know lebanon is a very expensive country specially Beirut. This is a restaurant in one of the most famous streets of Beirut, so it can't be cheap, but honestly compared to other places, their prices are okay, you can pay btw 10$ to 15$ for a delightful dinner and a beer (no meet).

They have both indoor and a small outdoor areas, but personally I prefer the terrace tables, as after 8pm the place gets so crowded specially during weekends.

The only drawback is that you have to be there before 8 pm, the unmatched timing is between (5:30 pm to 7pm), as if you go later I can't guarantee you to find a table.
After 11 pm the place becomes overcrowded and noisy, people get drunk and start dancing and singing out loudly, which I don't like and I find so annoying, but if you like partying, you would love the place.",1.0

Mohamad El Ghali,"Place is a great place to dine at. It has a good variety of food, from lebanese food such as batata 7ara, fatoush, tabouleh, mashewe, etc. To burgers and fries. The ambience there is great. There are book shelves everywhere which makes you think that this is a library not a restuarant. They have an upper floor used for meetings/reading if you're into this. Back to the food, its actually not bad at all. Batata 7arra is my favorite, and so I do recommend this place if you want some lebanese food in a quite environment",1.0
Fadi Al Kfouf,"Over-crowded apartment-like small place, too noisy as the tables are one feet far from each others, food is not even good (me no like), and the staff are not helpful and uncooperative, our order was not server correctly and no one could help, prices are very high comparing to the seating and what is served.

Saab Shmait,"üîπRating: 4/5
üîπExperience: A very nice and cozy space in the heart if hamra. Place is not exposed to hamra main street, so its not a noisy place, decoration is simple, outdoor area is nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful and service was very fast.
üîπFood: Menu is pure Lebanese, affordable and diverse. Quantities are quite enough. We ordered the following:
-Fatouch; was good but rocca is not my favorite in fatouch. It gives a bitter taste and doesn‚Äôt suits it.
-Shawarma lahme; tasted very good. Meat was tender and tasty.
-Mixed grill: Tasted very good as well. But the meat quantity was too little.
-Half grilled chicken: Was very tasty . Chicken was tender and still juicy.

Experience was very good . Place is highly recommended. üëçüëçüëçüëç",1.0

They even have what I wish all restaurants had - a side of mixed mezze including tabbouleh, hommus and the spicy coriander potatoes. For an often solo traveler like me, that give the opportunity of tasting several flavors without paying too much or wasting food. Last time I had this kibbeh mloukhieh - it's absolutely delicious.

The food was cold and very ordinary. they gave us the plates with  water spots in them, it felt like there is lack of hygiene and most importantly, the unfriendly attitude of the staff compared to the other Lebanese restaurants, maybe because the staff is small and the place is somehow crowded.

I do not think that I will visit him again and I do not recommend visiting him. I read previous reviews about this place a year or more ago about these problems and they are still going on and it seems that the owner of the restaurant does not care.",0.0

John Qattar,"First time here as ‚ÄòJohnny Foreigner‚Äô with my Lebanese wife. You can always tell how good a restaurant is by the presence of lots of locals and, by Jove, they come in their droves. We sat outside which was covered and with thick cellophane side panels to keep out the cold. This is an inexpensive restaurant by Beirut standards although the food quality is top-notch.

Positives:  Great Lebanese food, efficient service, pleasant ambience with lots of students, academics and residents. Am fussy about my Kofte and my serving preference was indulged. The chef also takes his french fries VERY seriously - perfect! Tables sufficiently well-spaced outside to allay fears of catching the Coof. Highlight for me was the Kaak Hallawa (pictured below) - Lebanese bread filled with a sweet sesame paste. Perfect on a late and cold Friday afternoon.

Negatives - little bit Smokey outside as we were fairly well enclosed due to the cool weather. Couch style seating a bit low for me as a hulking Anglo-Saxon.

Summary: This is a conveniently-located restaurant in Hamra serving honest, delicious Lebanese food at reasonable prices. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",1.0

It's a very nice and cozy Lebanese restaurant.

Food quality and quantity is really good. Prices are so fair. If you know Mezyan, they are both almost the same idea but with a little bit different menus.

I prefer Mezyan's terrace, but if it is crowded I directly head to Place. The atmosphere of the place is really quiet and relaxing (not as crowded as Mezyan), people there are so friendly, they have tawla so you can play with your friends (no tawla at Mezyan).

It's my second favorite place in Hamra after Mezyan.",1.0

Open a vent in the tent, puh-lease, so we don't get drowned in second hand smoke. A common inanity in Beirut. Also, please stop using citric acid (E33) instead of fresh lemon, and make sure all ingredients are natural, and let us know when you'll wise up to that. Another inanity in Beirut, the land of citrus.",1.0

I have been a loyal costumer for quite a few years, not only eating most meals there but Introducing it to most of my friends and visitors.
The restaurant has always been very busy, however, lately, the staff manners in welcoming and communicatng with costumers have been nothing but what can be described as rude and careless. No compassion for costumers, no warm greetings and no sign of hospitality, at least not good hospitality.
It's a shame to see one of your favorite spots fall into the trap of arrogance and nonchalantly. A policy that only shows bad attitude and the lack of the community spirit that made the place what it is.",0.0

Safwan Kamal,"Cozy restaurant, scrumptious food and very friendly staff. Didn‚Äôt find it too expensive. You gotta try this restaurant if you are in Hamra or even if you‚Äôre in Beirut. It‚Äôs inside a tiny shopping center. Some said it‚Äôs difficult to find, but if you the shopping center is right in front of you (and credit Libanais or Bank of Beirut is behind you), then the corner Starbucks should be on your right, walk straight past Starbucks while it is on your right, go to the end of the shopping center and you will see this restaurant in the left most corner, I don‚Äôt think we saw the Place sign, and asked somebody where the restaurant was. The entrance is relatively tiny, but you go and then can sit either inside or outside in the court-yard. Inside was way too cozy for me so we sat outside.

Sukaina Nasser,"I must say that the food here is my favourite in Beirut. It's authentic and delicious. Must try the chicken livers...very tasty! We usually order home delivery and it's always smooth and prompt. I occasionally go there if I'm in hamra. It's a laid back place, with a nice terrace. It can get a bit crowded and the service can be a bit slow, but it's worth it.",1.0

Derek E,"Used to go to the old location, this location is much better specially the outside seating and atmosphere, forgot to order the kibbeh mloukeyeh which is a specialty but everything was on point except the chicken shawarma that lacked the spices and was more tawouk wedges the garlic dip made it up though, would recommend the hot potatoes, chicken liver, sojuk , hummus, makanek, was told they also have a good mosakhan which is a Palestinian dish but didn't try it, overall a must visit restaurant in Hamra",1.0
