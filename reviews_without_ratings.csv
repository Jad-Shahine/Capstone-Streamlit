Wael Nuweihed,Cosy and warm environment with delicious food. Service could be slightly better though.
K H,"Echo others comments that it's not obvious to find - it's in the left back corner of the small mall. Worth finding. Lots of locals. Food was good and reasonably priced for Beirut. Chicken livers really great, as was fried cauliflower and eggplant."
Bilal Mousawi,"Service lacked any warmth or friendliness, felt very unwelcome."
Faiezah Shahid,"Very nice environment, quite busy. Food was fresh n tasty. Staff is very corteous. Popular with tourists."

Hadi Khodr,"My number one restaurant in the globe,  situated in hamra street beirut"
Leen Karim,Chicken liver dish was overcooked and tough. Didn't meet the expectations for a Lebanese specialty.
Breta Bujupi,"Everyone said this place was great, but it was meh. Tried lots of dishes, super disappointed."

Dareen Fostok,"Perfect food, quick service, kind waitresses"
Midwife MAM,"Very great food, nice drinks, lovely place"
HERCULES berg/mann,Very good food and delicious.
kamel zebib,"A place for a quick low-budget social lunch or dinner, an excellent place to meet friends and have a chat listen to nice oriental and sub-culture music. Food is average and economical, priced just a bit over street-food but tasty and generous. Customers are the type that live on the fringes of mainstream society and low budget tourists."
Anthony Zammar,"Extremely disappointing service. Despite placing an order well in advance, the food arrived an hour late, completely ruining my lunch plans. The operator's repeated promises of a 2-minute delay and evasive responses added to the frustration. The lack of transparency and failure to meet the promised delivery time left me thoroughly dissatisfied"

Wiss S,I love this place!
Gabriella D'Elia,"Great food at very reasonable price, especially for Beirut üòÅ. ‚Ä¶"

Philip Kerr,Really great food and atmosphere
Hind Naim,Extremely disappointed with the fattoush salad; it was soggy and lacked freshness. The noise level in the restaurant made it hard to enjoy the meal.

Albert Van den Berg,"Always a great choice. The food has consistent quality over time and a large variety of appetizers, salads and main courses. Batata harra portion is huge, lentil soup is delicious, but my favorite item in their menu is tomato kibbeh. Welcoming outdoor terrace gives it a fresh and authentic vibe. The service was fast on my last visit."
Rabih Ar,"Nice place if you‚Äôre into Lebanese mezze in the heart of Beirut. A bit tricky to find for first-timers, but it never hurts to ask for directions ‚úåÔ∏èüèª

The food was great, fresh and tasty. We tried the cauliflower and eggplant plate, it was very tasty. The kafta aarayis were a bit dry or overcooked.

All in all its a nice restaurant, the staff are friendly and helpful and the place was clean most importantly."
Simon Rahal,Nice restaurant with a great atmosphere! Feels like your sitting in past-Beirut. Food is great : a modern take on Lebanese dishes. Overall a great place to spend a night with friends.

mansour,One of gd destination in hamra..no view a bit crowded yet gd food and gd pricing..near 24/7 and minutes phones shop
Haitham Chehadi,"Clean and delicious
Not that expensive
Service good, accurate , professional and relatively fast and fresh
Atmosphere crowded and a bit noisy
Not for calm or romantic gathering or dates
Noon and afternoons during weekdays best light crowd
Enjoy"
Ms Su,Good food and nice restaurant
Tomas Netrval,"Music was too loud, couldnít enjoy our conversation. The chicken was also over-spiced."
Leonardo Picarelli,The place tries too hard to be trendy but fails in delivering basic dining comfort.
Katie Horsfield,Really fantastic Lebanese food. Relaxed and friendly vibe.
Tom S,"Service slow and not particularly friendly, food expensive for what it is - clay pot baked rice chicken was basically grilled chicken over microwaved rice. Poor show - expected a lot more given the positive effects reviews. Better places around"
Khalil Murad,Service is very good. Staff very friendly. Setting/Atmosphere is very pleasant. Compared to other Lebanese restaurants food is ok. The beef kebab needs an upgrade.
Tetiana Leshchuk,"The food and atmosphere and service is AMAZING. Try mousakhan djej, these chicken rolls are the best!"
Omar Kheir,"Disappointing falafel wrap, tasted stale. Also, the restaurant was too loud to have a conversation."
Vasileios Vlachakis,"Ordered traditional Lebanese sweets, but they lacked authenticity and were too sugary."
Mohamad El Ghali,"Place is a great place to dine at. It has a good variety of food, from lebanese food such as batata 7ara, fatoush, tabouleh, mashewe, etc. To burgers and fries. The ambience there is great. There are book shelves everywhere which makes you think that this is a library not a restuarant. They have an upper floor used for meetings/reading if you're into this. Back to the food, its actually not bad at all. Batata 7arra is my favorite, and so I do recommend this place if you want some lebanese food in a quite environment"
Fadi Al Kfouf,"Over-crowded apartment-like small place, too noisy as the tables are one feet far from each others, food is not even good (me no like), and the staff are not helpful and uncooperative, our order was not server correctly and no one could help, prices are very high comparing to the seating and what is served. I apologize for the bad rating but you need to fix it."
Jordi Casas,"Tasty food and nice service, authentic Lebanese food."
Salah Zoghaib,Fresh food by excellence. Restaurant of leftist and progressive people. Affordable prices.

Adam Karaki,great place in the heart of hamra to just sit and chill and enjoy a bite to eat.

hamzeh smadi,"Nice atmosphere but not for families
Appetizers are awesome
Tried it two times both were excellent"
Nour Alam,"Excellent food, lovely ambiance, fair prices"
Marwan Ayache,"Good meza, but it's hard to find a place in Lebanon that doesn't have that. Otherwise, it's a nicely central (in Hamra), and even has a outdoor garden that puts you in that cozy village vibe."
maan nasreddine,The beef shawarma was tough and flavorless. Expected better in Beirut.
Robyn Huang,"This place is super cute with delicious mezza plates. All the dishes were huge portions. It was lovely sitting on the patio, but the inside is nicely decorated as well. The wait staff is super patient with explaining the lengthy menu and making suggestions."
Christelle Rabil,"Poorly managed, with staff members arguing in front of customers. The mezze platter was mediocre at best."
John Erwin,Great food.  Location in a mini mall in Hamra
Emad Karim,Delicious Lebanese food and great staff. Located in the heart of Hamara with indoor and outdoor sections.The Resturant is usually busy so better make a reservation before heading out there. Weekends are more busy than weekdays.
√ñnder Uzun,"Music was too loud, overshadowing the dining experience. The falafel was greasy and heavy."
Shant Kerbabian,"The restaurant was overcrowded, making it uncomfortable. The kefta was more filler than meat."
Layal The Guide,"Best of the best lebanese restaurants located in hamra, prices are so affordable, any one must try it, most of there food is served with debs el remmen which is very tasty"
Jihan Masri,The restaurant was smoky and uncomfortable for non-smokers. The garlic sauce was too overpowering.

Naji hy,A good place to meet a friend and eating some traditional food which is fattah
Marcel Rached,Great Mediterranean food. Welcoming staff and pleasant atmosphere.
Saab Shmait,"üîπRating: 4/5
üîπExperience: A very nice and cozy space in the heart if hamra. Place is not exposed to hamra main street, so its not a noisy place, decoration is simple, outdoor area is nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful and service was very fast.
üîπFood: Menu is pure Lebanese, affordable and diverse. Quantities are quite enough. We ordered the following:
-Fatouch; was good but rocca is not my favorite in fatouch. It gives a bitter taste and doesn‚Äôt suits it.
-Shawarma lahme; tasted very good. Meat was tender and tasty.
-Mixed grill: Tasted very good as well. But the meat quantity was too little.
-Half grilled chicken: Was very tasty . Chicken was tender and still juicy.

Experience was very good . Place is highly recommended. üëçüëçüëçüëç"
Pilar Sanchez Ala√±on,A very nice place to drink or dinner something. The staff very friendly.
Alain Aouad,Nice food and authentic local ambiance
Susana M,"Great place for Lebanese food, reasonably priced. Buzzy atmosphere and casual. Had the tabbouleh which was amazing. Only reason why I gave it 3 star is because I think my main was ok. Ordered the clay pot rice with meat. Think if I had other mezze/grilled foods it would have been better."
Leslie,"Love their fattouch!!!
staff is very friendly too. very cosy place
coming back soon"
Muhammad yusif Hajar,"Highly recommended
Great customer service
Definitely revisit this place"

Sacco Dermoussissian,"Tables were too close to each other, making it an uncomfortable dining experience."
barrak naamani,nice place in middle of hamra. nice garden good food & good value for money as well. service could be much better.
MN AL,Very crowded almost all the time. Food is normal. It is allowed to smoke inside so I would not advise you to go there if you don't. Actually there is nothing special there at all but the expensive prices and the very noisy environment. Wouldn't go there again unless extremely necessary.
Daniel Auger,"Excellent service , excellent food, beautiful vibe ... a place to drink, eat , socialize ...
Keep it up !"
Rami Showno,"You can't visit Lebanon without visiting Place, the Oriental food is amazing especially the ""potato with coriander"". You will enjoy every bite.
The service is Great and the staff is very well trained."
Valery Legasov,Beautiful Lebanese food and vegetarian daily dish
Aluisio Barros,"I have now been to T a few times. And I can say it is my favorite place in downtown. It has a large variety of dishes, everything is at least very good. The place is cozy, the service is friendly, and the prices are good. They even have what I wish all restaurants had - a side of mixed mezze including tabbouleh, hommus and the spicy coriander potatoes. For an often solo traveler like me, that give the opportunity of tasting several flavors without paying too much or wasting food. Last time I had this kibbeh mloukhieh - it's absolutely delicious. Add to all this good wine by the glass. Have I convinced you? :)))"
Hussam Ghaleb,"For me, this is a place a go to everytime I visit Beirut. Food is tasty, service is good, and the place has an identity"
Mohamed Abd El Wahed,"Best Lebanese food restaurant, reasonable prices, very friendly staff."
Christopher Butler,"Nice environment, great food! Not so great service..."
Robin Lindblom,"Love this place, a must if you're in the area. A true lebanese resturant. üëå ‚Ä¶"
Rami Massoud,"The bathrooms were filthy, and it reflected the overall lack of cleanliness in the restaurant."
Ali Hammoud,Mint lemonade was too sweet and artificial tasting. Not refreshing as hoped.
Imad Slailaty,Had to constantly ask for water refills. The place lacked attentive service.
Jairus Onsafari,"Great Lebanese restaurant in Hamra. Creative menu, generous portions, good price, lovely clientele and great service. Worth a try"
Simon Wright,"Food was awful and the service slow and unfriendly. I had kibbe with yoghurt and it was heavy, claggy and not nice at all. The coriander potatoes were soggy and unpleasant. I was disappointed as the reviews were good but my experience was not worthy of anything other than 2 stars."
Martin France (Marty),Good food and service. Reasonably priced drinks.
DOUAA SAMAD,"Best lebanese food ever, can't skip my visit to beirut without passing by the restaurant. The food is great. I usually order batata harra, taouk platter,  fattoush, hommos, eggplant fatteh."
ole sag,"Great place, great value for your money. Very busy, but the staff works efficiently. Great Fattoush and lentil kibbeh. Clear recommendation!"
Aiman Fawzi,"Amazing environment and place, casual but elegant, tasty and not expensive"
Hayl Al-Salehi,"The place is nice and the food is decent. However, it is usually full and the food takes a bit to be ready"
Raghdi Bizri,"The place was dirty, with uncleaned tables and floors. Not what I expected for a popular Beirut restaurant."
Kurt Vinion,A fantastic restaurant with excellent food - we ate here twice it was so good!
waleed ashi,"One of the best restaurants I experienced in Beirut.  The food is beyond amazing.  The service is reasonable.  The price is very reasonable for the quality.  I recommend it to everyone.  What reminded me most of it was Rich Caf√© in downtown Cairo.  With the difference, of course.  I advise everyone to visit it"
Tarek Khadra,Good food nice service great location
Matthew Smith,Really good Lebanese food and great portion sizes with a cool vibe.
Johnny Waked,"Good food, service and ambience."
Salma Abdo,"Excellent quality and very good prices. The restaurant itself is lovely whether sitting inside near the books or outside on the terrace. Service is fast and the staff very friendly. If you‚Äôre ever in Beirut, you must eat at T Marbuta!"
Tarek nassar,Nice food and nice atmosphere. Service is good but we had to stay for a while on the waiting list
Myriam Sakkal,Lebanese food. Nice decor but the taste isnt very satisfying.
Razzak Ansari,"The place is cozy,  the food good,  and price very reasonable."
Alia Ajami,Really nice and cosi place! Food is amazing and the staff polite and friendly!!
Ayham Kato,"The place is ok, maybe for drinking coffee and tea, but not for eating at all, as the food is not good.  The food was cold and very ordinary. they gave us the plates with  water spots in them, it felt like there is lack of hygiene and most importantly, the unfriendly attitude of the staff compared to the other Lebanese restaurants, maybe because the staff is small and the place is somehow crowded.

I do not think that I will visit him again and I do not recommend visiting him. I read previous reviews about this place a year or more ago about these problems and they are still going on and it seems that the owner of the restaurant does not care."
victorien sukarieh,"the food is just amazing, can't get enough of that rice dish"
Amer Omar,"This place has become an icon of Hamra Street. Great cultural hub, great local food, lovely staff. Unpretentious and for the service they offer fairly priced. Definitely a good hangout spot."
Sana C,Excellent food. Creative twists on old favorites. Every thing was very tasty.Wish we had taken pictures of the feast we had. Nice setting with an outdoor patio. Would definitely go again.
John Qattar,"First time here as ‚ÄòJohnny Foreigner‚Äô with my Lebanese wife. You can always tell how good a restaurant is by the presence of lots of locals and, by Jove, they come in their droves. We sat outside which was covered and with thick cellophane side panels to keep out the cold. This is an inexpensive restaurant by Beirut standards although the food quality is top-notch.

Positives:  Great Lebanese food, efficient service, pleasant ambience with lots of students, academics and residents. Am fussy about my Kofte and my serving preference was indulged. The chef also takes his french fries VERY seriously - perfect! Tables sufficiently well-spaced outside to allay fears of catching the Coof. Highlight for me was the Kaak Hallawa (pictured below) - Lebanese bread filled with a sweet sesame paste. Perfect on a late and cold Friday afternoon.

Negatives - little bit Smokey outside as we were fairly well enclosed due to the cool weather. Couch style seating a bit low for me as a hulking Anglo-Saxon.

Summary: This is a conveniently-located restaurant in Hamra serving honest, delicious Lebanese food at reasonable prices. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
Anand Sudhakaran,"Food was awesome. Pot rice with chicken was superb. Very busy restaurant, Crowded  luckily got seat."
Tareq D,Extremely slow service despite the restaurant being overcrowded. The waiters seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.

Kirill Vasilyev,Loud groups made the atmosphere chaotic. Couldn't enjoy our meal in peace.
Hasan Salame,Had to ask multiple times for water. The restaurant was hectic and disorganized.
Sergeo Armani,"Ordered a vegetarian platter, but it was mostly just filler foods. Overhyped place."
Steve N,"Hidden in the back of the mini mall. Go straight back past the Starbucks, and look for the last door on the left. It's next to an electronics shop and doesn't have a visible sign on the door. Great food and amazing vibes here."
Cori O,Delicious food nice atmosphere and good service.
ENGINEER Eng.Asim,Great taste and nice area üëå ‚Ä¶

Fadi Hamouch,"Best ever restaurant excellent food friendly staff, I love it."
Fares Halabi,"Ordered the lamb chops, but they arrived overcooked and tough. The service was slow, even though the restaurant wasn't that busy."
Tobias M√∂rike,"Staff seemed disinterested and the falafel was greasy. Also, too smoky inside for a non-smoker."
Joe Daou,"Service lacked personal touch, felt very rushed and impersonal. The kafta was dry and lacked flavor, not what I expected from a Lebanese grill."
Thijs Sicking,"A hidden treasure if you ask us! In the shadow of the big Starbucks is Place. With both tables inside and outside on the courtyard it has plenty of places, but nevertheless gets (almost) fully booked. Understandable when you taste the delicious Lebanese dishes. Very good quality for a more than reasonable price! Definitely worth a visit when in Beirut, looking for a nice place to experience the Lebanese kitchen."
Ziad Suidan,"The arak was diluted, not the quality expected in Beirut. The overall experience was disappointing."
Robin Schottelndreier,The food was delicious. Best hallumi I ever had. The garden was beautiful and the servers very nice.
Zeina Saydi,Best restaurant in town great food in a nice atmosphere. I highly recommend it.
Samer Alhamwi,"poor value for the money
location is good
staff are cold in general
If you are coming to drink wine NOT to eat this is the right place.
I do not recommend it for families only singles."
chadi dalida,"The shawarma plate was disappointing, with the meat being both dry and flavorless."
Mitri Karam,The lamb was overcooked and tough. Hardly the quality you'd expect in Beirut.
Gohary936,Falafel sandwich was bland and the bread was stale. Not what I expected from a Lebanese eatery.
Lara Ghrawy,Nice place üëçüèª I just love it! I wish it was bigger with more tables ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Ä¶
Islam Diaa,"Great restaurant, very nice and cozy. Their salads and appetizers are amazing. The chicken shawerma can improve, not very different from the one you make at home. Red Tawook is amazing. Their waiters need to pay more attention also when the restaurant is busy. In brief, I still recommend this whenever you are in Hamra."
Yalcin Kaya,"The food was very delicuous, a bit salty for me. Especially I liked shakshouka with meat. It was a littlr hard to find. We passed by the door, but couldn't understand it was Place."
Daniel Manrique Lopez,"Great place, great food and great staff"
Shadi Diab,Waiter got our order wrong and didnít apologize. Very chaotic environment.

Nada Awada,cosy small restaurant.Good Lebanese food and service.Reasonable prices
robert ianjim,Great place to have some mezze. It is a bit hard to find as the entrance is pretty small and a bit hidden but it is really rewarding. I recommend it for breakfast!
Soha Daroub,"Despite its popularity, the restaurant failed to provide a comfortable dining environment."
Kristen Potter,"Chicken shish was chewy and the drinks were overpriced. Plus, the place feels too cramped."
Miled Rizk,i ate there like 4 times. i liked the quality of the Lebanese traditional food. the prices are reasonable too.
Myra Zeyneddine,The loudness of the restaurant made it hard to have a conversation. The ambiance was more stressful than relaxing.
Daniel Rosie,"Small place quite difficult to find. It have an inside terrace which is very simple and sprouted by walls. Food was ok but not exceptional, I belive the place is a bit overrated. Yes the food is not bad but not exceptional, price is on the high side for the location and the quality"
"Soltan Hassanieh, CFE, CACM","First, the food really is good. The hummus with garlic and hot peppers is amazing. The mixed green salad was ample to share and the vinegar mix on it light and perfect. Eggplant hot appetizer was amazing.
Vegan friendly.
The only drawback was that wrong dishes placed on our table. We started in on them wondering if it was an ‚Äúevery table gets this‚Äù item and just as quick they were whisked away. I hope the fried cheese plate with one piece partially eaten wasn‚Äôt served to whomever ordered it!
I‚Äôll be back."
Post-training Cravings,"One of our favorite lebanese relaxed places. perfect for a relaxed atmosphere or a casual date. friendly staff, with a place full of books and arabic authentic music.
favorite dishes are by far, fatte bi batenjen, batata harra, soujouk and makanek with debs el remmen. for drinks i love their iced tea peach which is not refill and has its own blend."
Marwan Trad,"The place was overcrowded, and we felt cramped. The vegetarian options were limited and not satisfying. Left feeling like it wasnít worth the price or the wait."
Zeinab Dirani,"I ordered the daily dish (crispy fish)
Delievery came fast and the food was hot
The fish, fries, and sauce are very delicious. The portion is decent and the value for price is very good.
I highly recommend daily dishes though i love their side dishes (batata harra and hummus)"
Fady T,Nice place and delicious foodüëç ‚Ä¶
Diana Maatouk,"I've didn't visited Place but i order food via delviery, the food is very delicious &  the portions are big :)"

Raphael Z,Cozy place with a gorgeous garden behind. Good start to get to know meze
Wael Safa,Lovely staff and food. Make sure to order Fattouche and Hot potato
Christina Abboud,"Delicious authentic Lebanese food. Casual, crowded until late, for a reason. Hidden gem in Hamra."
Doctor A.S.,"Delicious breakfast in a cozy place . Excellent staff,  fair prices."
Adib Dorra,"This place is keeping its traditions since so many years, and it's doing great. Food tastes so good, the environment is so friendly and the staff are decent and well trained.
You have to try their tabbouleh, chilly fries, wings, escalope, and their hummus with meat.
The outdoor decorations make u feel like sitting in an old restaurant in the village, the indoor area includes w 2 floors library with a reading area and a bar."
Ibrahim Fadol,Amazing and cozy atmosphere with delicious food and relaxing music. A must visit in Beirut
Joshua Knight,"We had an exceptionally splendid evening at this restaurant! Everything we ate was scrumptious, although indeed in medium portions, super fast service which was also kind and generous. They have fairly good Internet here. Choose either the first or the second. The Wi-Fi password is 123456123456. The restroom was nice but I ended up throwing away a few towels and pushing down in the wastebasket to make it look Nice. I was still able to wash my hands with soap and water afterwards to get clean for my scrumptious dinner :-) we ate on a Thursday evening at about 6:45 PM and the place was packed. We ate outside and there were no mosquitoes and it was delightful on this October evening. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Peace, Joshua"
Emir Diab,"The best of the best, super friendly waiters and amazing atmosphere.

I eat there everyday."
Irina Catescu,"Amazing lebanese food, the mezze are super fresh and delicious.
We had tabbouleh, potatoes, hummus, labneh and tomato kibbe and they were delicious.
Definitely recommend it if you‚Äôre in Hamra, Beirut."

Rami Don't stalk me,"Very relaxing vibe, suitable for chilling out and talking to friends over a cup of coffee. The drinks were great. I also really like the library upstairs. It adds a very unique touch to the caf√© and is neatly organized.

However, it literally took me 10 minutes to locate the entrance because the sign wasn't that big and it was literally inside the caf√©. There needs to be a bigger sign or something to indicate the enterance. It'd also draw much more attention to the place.

Nevertheless, I would still recommend it."
Jay Nee,"A wonderful restaurant and a very nice atmosphere. friendly staff, surprisingly the food was super good, very authentic and good prices not so expensive at all."
Elias Chnais,"I think their food quality went down over the years, but it is still a nice place to hang out with friends."
Maya Rizk,Used to be tastier service is slow
Rudy,"An excellent Lebanese twist and library .
A place where you can spend a full day"
Nader Farfour,"The kebbe nayyeh was not fresh, which is concerning for a raw dish."

Aya Refaat,"Highly recommended.

It's a very nice and cozy Lebanese restaurant.

Food quality and quantity is really good. Prices are so fair. If you know Mezyan, they are both almost the same idea but with a little bit different menus.

I prefer Mezyan's terrace, but if it is crowded I directly head to Place. The atmosphere of the place is really quiet and relaxing (not as crowded as Mezyan), people there are so friendly, they have tawla so you can play with your friends (no tawla at Mezyan).

It's my second favorite place in Hamra after Mezyan."

Hani Asfour,"Great hidden spot in Beirut, great food, alternative scene, good vibes. Here are the buts: service is slow, you have to flag down the team, who are energetic but almost always distracted, and oh, the smoking inside the tent, what's with that? Open a vent in the tent, puh-lease, so we don't get drowned in second hand smoke. A common inanity in Beirut. Also, please stop using citric acid (E33) instead of fresh lemon, and make sure all ingredients are natural, and let us know when you'll wise up to that. Another inanity in Beirut, the land of citrus."
Abraam Magued,"Top restaurant. Have been in beirut for 6 days, got our dinner there half of our stay. Very tasty food, relatively moderate prices, cheerful stuff, cozy place. You must try all of their mezza menu. Only take off, they should add more variety in main dishes in their menu."
Ramona Rouhana,"I love everything about this placs. Very authentic. Food is good, prices are so affordable. U can choose among too many dishes, between the small or the big portion. Staff are very friendly and helpful. This place is always crowdy and almost always full house."
Mohamad Yaghi,The service is extremely slow. The food is below average. The music shifts between genre randomly which is too bad given that it's a place with a theme and it is very loud which defeats the purpose of being in a social environnent. The staff is not very friendly and not here to help. The chairs are uncomfortable.

Caroline Alam,The food is heavenly.the best tasting lebanese restaurant with affordable prices.everything is great
Charbel Aad,"I am very disappointed.
I have been a loyal costumer for quite a few years, not only eating most meals there but Introducing it to most of my friends and visitors.
The restaurant has always been very busy, however, lately, the staff manners in welcoming and communicatng with costumers have been nothing but what can be described as rude and careless. No compassion for costumers, no warm greetings and no sign of hospitality, at least not good hospitality.
It's a shame to see one of your favorite spots fall into the trap of arrogance and nonchalantly. A policy that only shows bad attitude and the lack of the community spirit that made the place what it is."

Ahmed Mosad Safar,Great location and vintage decorations that sets for a good vibes experience. They probably have the best Fetoush salad in Hamra. Other than that the food is tasty but not big portions and the prices are not bad.
Renderus,No vegetarian options and the waiters were not helpful in suggesting alternatives.

My favorite dishes are Batata Harrara, Tawouk, Kebbet Laqtine and fattoushe!"
Abed,Waited 30 minutes for a table and another 30 for food. Not worth the wait for average Lebanese cuisine.
Rh√©a,"I LOVE this place! Although it's almost always crowded when I visit, the food, atmosphere, and affordability definitely make up for it. Since it's a Lebanese food restaurant, there are many vegan options for those of you who are looking to eat around this area. The options include but aren't limited by: lentil kebbe, pumpkin kebbe, tabboule, fattoush, various garden salads, coriander and spiced potatoes, hummus, beans, chickpeas in oil and spices, and rice-stuffed vine leaves."

Rami Jawhar,Amazing food and super decent prices for Beirut. Used to play music there with a band back when they were in the hotel across the street. The back garden is very nice too.
Safwan Kamal,"Cozy restaurant, scrumptious food and very friendly staff. Didn‚Äôt find it too expensive. You gotta try this restaurant if you are in Hamra or even if you‚Äôre in Beirut. It‚Äôs inside a tiny shopping center. Some said it‚Äôs difficult to find, but if you the shopping center is right in front of you (and credit Libanais or Bank of Beirut is behind you), then the corner Starbucks should be on your right, walk straight past Starbucks while it is on your right, go to the end of the shopping center and you will see this restaurant in the left most corner, I don‚Äôt think we saw the Place sign, and asked somebody where the restaurant was. The entrance is relatively tiny, but you go and then can sit either inside or outside in the court-yard. Inside was way too cozy for me so we sat outside.

Overall: 5 stars, for the amazing food, welcoming and friendly staff and great ambience."
Carl Salem,Unfortunately the staff were indifferent and unfriendly to extent we did not feel welcome. Not even a thank you when we paid.

Hadeel Ghazi,"I have found this place by chance and it was very well hidden.

Ahmad Abou Abass,A nice and relaxing place in the middle of busy Hamra

Frederico Martins Montanha,"It is a wonderful hidden gem in Hamra, that I found as a highlight in the Lonely Planet guide, and it is really a great place to enjoy a real and tasty Lebanese food. The Tabbouleh salad is simply delightful. When it is full the service might get a little slow and confusing but it is definitely worth it. Surely I will come back without hesitation on my next trip to Beirut."
Maher S,Good food with a decent selection of choices...
Vahid,"Nice environment, friendly staff, affordable prices, but don't get confused with the currency!"
Nabil Souk,Lebanese wine selection was limited and overpriced. Disappointing for a local establishment.
Rami Maamari,Great place for a gathering food time
Christina Peebles,A Hamra institution‚Äîbest place in the neighborhood to meet up with friends for good Lebanese food
Zaki Mahfoud,Good food nice ambiance pleasant waiters
Juliana Karma,"Stumbled upon this gem in the Hamra area and am so glad I did. The interior is really cool, trendy, and the back outdoor patio is just lovely. Great spot to eat, or just for coffee.

We stopped there a bit hungry, just wanting a few bites. We ordered Mutabaal, Tabbouleh, and the Pumpkin Kibbeh. Get all three things, trust me...they were to die for. The Pumpkin Kibbeh was especially unique...pumpkin exterior and spinach on the inside..yum!

Only wish I was hungrier so I could try more of their food!"
Maya Haydar,"Very nice place, music slightly loud. Food was great especially the potatoes with garlic and coriander and the sausages in pomegranate sauce. The salads are tasty and the appetizers are a must try. Staff are exceptional!"
Dawn Shannon,"Cute little restaurant/caf√©, not too pricey, friendly staff."
Nabil Azoury,"Baba ghanoush was overly smoked, losing its delicate balance of flavors."
Mohd Ali,Excellent place to eat
Georgia Gibson,"This place is the best spot in Beirut in my opinion. The food is better than anywhere else but is the same price. There are so many options for what to eat and great vegan meals. It would be a 5 star review but the service is surprisingly poor considering how many staff there are, it‚Äôs almost impossible to get someone‚Äôs attention! Otherwise perfect."
Elio Haddad (URFreeNow),Must visit. Lebanese food with contemporary atmosphere good prices.
Pariz,lovely restaurant with good atmos. sandwiches and salad were delicious.
Youssef Naiim,Foul mudammas was bland and unseasoned. The overall culinary experience was forgettable.
Silvia ‚ÄúIside65‚Äù Torelli,"Nice, lovely place with good for a, good drinks, books and table games. I love it!"
Roy Abou jaoude,"Amazing food, ok service"
Montaha Nattah,"Place is one of my favorite restaurants in Lebanon!! The food is so delicious and tempting, especially their soup, salads, escalope and batata harra!
The services are amazing, the location is nice as well. It is located in hamra, beirut, which is considered one of the main and most crowded streets in Lebanon. Many tourists go to Place because they get to try the most delicious Lebanese food there! That‚Äôs why it is always crowded, and sometimes you can‚Äôt even find a free table! The prices are fine as well, because the portions are always big. You just can‚Äôt visit Beirut without visiting Place. It‚Äôs definitely a MUST VISIT KIND OF A PLACE!

Food: 10/10
Environment: 10/10

Farouk Al Boukhari,"For Lebanese standard very bad food. Small portions slow service, definitely not worth the prices... real tourist place"
