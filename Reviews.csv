Ragi Gebeily,5,"The place is awesome , great vibes, the waiters and barmen are great. The food used to be better.
Not anymore ."
Irina Catescu,5,"Delicious Lebanese food and the staff is very friendly. There is also a small terrace and they have live music in different nights. It's a great place to go in Hamra, Beirut."
Sana. Ch,1,"Ridiculous, I ordered the daily vegetarian dish and I got something that wants to be a tasteless fattoush with boiled potatos! Had even ordered fries and they were damp.."
Nicky Erdle,5,"Amazing food and atmosphere and super friendly servers. Loved the beet dip, aubergine labneh and hummus. Would recommend!!!!

Also there was a very fun and entertaining Lebanese band playing after 10 pm. Great evening out."
≈ûeymanur Y√∂nt,5,"We have spent a Saturday evening there, and the vibe was amazing. First of all, service is really good, and staff is friendly. Yeran was so helpful, she explained us all the food, and answered our questions sincerely.

The place was clean, and they serve food and alcohol.

We have tried kibbeh, chicken w tahini, fatata harra, and moutabal. Chicken with tahini was really original and tasty. Cocktails were tasty as well.

The night ended with a DJ playing Arabic songs. All the people there were dancing and it was lovely to be part of it!

I could not recommend there enough to anyone who visits Beirut!"
Lilian Amatoury (Liliantheguide),5,"Don't miss the band night every thursday! Amazing lebanese vibes, delicious food üòç one of the best mante in Beirutüòç"
Dr Fady Hachem,4,We loved this place ‚Ä¶ the food is good ‚Ä¶ they serve Lebanese and Armenian cuisine ‚Ä¶.the portions are generous ‚Ä¶ but what we enjoyed the most was the live band ‚Ä¶. Performing  Lebanese and Arabic oldies ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it was a little bit crowded ‚Ä¶. i recommend  this place ‚Ä¶
Sylvio Hleiss,5,One of the best Lebanese restaurants in the Hamra area. Food was delicious and personnel were friendly. Recommended to book beforehand on days where bands are playing.
Burcu Filiz,5,"It's a cute little place with great food, 3 mezzas + 1 Armenian kebbeh + 1/4 arak costs around 25‚Ç¨ which is very good compared to the taste. The music can be a bit loud, just be aware of that and you'll have a great time."
Jessica,5,"Delicious food, great wine selection, lovely staff. Ambiance is spot on. Can recommend the fatteh, and moutabbel and anything with melted cheese"
Hanine Abdel Rahman,5,"I Love the ambiance and was waiting for the opportunity to try their lunch.
The waiters are so helpful and discrete. We were welcomed by a bread basket and a cup of debs remman as we requested!
We ordered:
-their exquisite fattoush: not to be missed with the tastiest dressing
- The Zaalouk: our all time addiction. for those who never tired it, a must: it is a Moroccan mezza of eggplants, pepper and tomatoes perfectly blended
- Chicken and lemon tajine with a side of couscous: with lots of caramelized onions and delicious Moroccan seasoning

If you have not visited them yet you should!

One of  my previous experiences is detailed below

I love everything about this place, day or night it has this addictive thing that keeps u wana come back. Food with high quality, tasty and very well presented. Some of the servers are not really in good mood lol but still u get some others very helpful;)they often have events too.i ve been three times last year to their book bazar where we enjoyed buffets and last time fr dinner.u must try it"
Sarah Aoun,5,"Amazing food, quick service with very reasonable prices and proper portions"
Sofia Antunes,5,Great Lebanese & Armenian food with Very special dj sets
Mohammad Bitar,5,"Very very good food and excellent service they always win for typical Lebanese food ü•∞ü•∞
It costs us 10 dollars per person there was 8 Portion on the table and tea and water so that's great ‚Ä¶"
Lewis Tullett,5,Wow what delicious food! Go for the Armenian options like the kibbe and fatteh. Reasonable prices but the quality and freshness is unmatched locally. Must visit. Also so nice to have clean air without smokers inside.
May Shigenobu,5,"The food here very clean and delicious. The food menu is from all this region (Lebanese, Armenian, North African).
You can experience the fun and Lebanese nightlife here on weekends. Restaurant turns into a dance atmosphere after 9:30pm.
On Thursdays, they have a live band event.
On Friday and Saturday they have a DJ dance atmosphere after 9:00 pm.
So if you are going on these days it's better to reserve a table for dinner early and stay for the events."
Nancy H.,5,"** Hidden gem in hamra **
I tried the food was amazing, portions were huge, the seating was nice, simple and good decorations, the staff were amazing too!
A must try."
Abu Marwan,3,"Mezyan used to be one of favorite resturant in Hamra . Good location , good service , friendly staff. In my recent visit on September 29th , I saw major deterioration in the service by waiters and waitresses , and even not friendly atmosphere. Gone the time of good services of Aisha and her colleagues. The food too is below average in one of their significant dish , Kuskos .
The administration of the restaurant need to have a serious look to the day to day functioning of the restaurant"
John Qattar,5,"Lunch here is a calm and pleasant experience. The restaurant's modest entrance belies a vast interior, bit like the tardis in the Dr Who tv series.
This is not just another cookie-cutter Lebanese restaurant. Plenty of different dishes to try. Aside from the dish of the day, recommend the roasted peppers with delicious feta cheese topping and the Moroccan Kofte balls in tomato sauce.
Oh, they have draught Beirut 961 IPA, a pint of which was served chilled.
For the money, a well-deserved 5 stars."
AB BC,4,First started coming here in early 2016 and thankfully it has managed to survive with almost exactly the same menu since then and kept its friendly (though overworked) service. The only thing that has changed is the atmosphere and the crowd it attracts - so many people have left Beirut or are struggling that it's very much a place for those who can afford their prices. I believe it has some of the best food I've ever had anywhere - and will always come here  :)
Nicole Yeo,5,"this is really delicious place, nice vibes too. the different dips were good and kebbe too. the wines that were recommended was good too. the staff were friendly and helpful. ‚Ä¶"
Ali Ali,4,"We went there for dinner .. the place is so nice and the vibes were great .. a lot of people were there for drinking or eating or just a cup of coffee .. the food is ok nothing special .. and the staff were amazingly friendly .. in general we enjoyed our stay ..
Prices were affordable .."
Aur Ghs,5,"Located in Hamra steet, the place offers lebanese food and some other middle eastern food.
We ordered: the moroccan kafta, hommos, fries, cheese rkakat, fatouch and a bottle of water for 92 000 LBP.
The service was fast, the food delicious and good portions for two people.
They have an outdoor seating as well.
The ambiance is oriental music, expect umm kalthoum, fairuz and others.
Super recommended."
Lama ghandour,2,used to be my favorite place. they increased the prices insanely and decreased their quality of food. ur supposed to do either of them. I dnt recommend it. but maybe it is still nice for thursday and friday parties.
Hachem Hassan,3,"I was urged to try the place for the food quality
The place is cozy and amazing staff
Friendly and fast service
Good presentation is good
Just most of the food was sour
I know it's more lebanese Armenian food and they need to use summak plus mulases
But still I find it so sour
I tried most of the mezza
Msakhan, chicken liver, sausages, kibbe armenian, sou boerek, Manti and kebab with cheery
The Manti was the best.. but again was sour ...
The cherry kebab was so dry and the  meat didn't taste that good"
Alper balcƒ±,1,Worst food i have ever eaten. Waitresses are helping you to choose worst dishes only. 
Ghaida Bouchaala,5,Had my first ever Kunefa and it tasted so good! The staff is really kind and I had one of the best nights in Beirut attending a band's musical show there.
Emir Diab,5,"Great atmosphere, great food,, just come before 7pm if you have social anxiety like me haha. Beautiful."
Roy Ha,5,"Mezyan never disappoints! I've always enjoyed dinning and winning there. The staff is friendly the owner even more. Food is just perfect. The moutabls are pure taste. The salads are fresh and the seasoning are well balanced. The meats tastes great, although I would have appreciated just a tad less pomegranate molasses on them. The mouajanat are crispy and tasteful. The kebbe both 2ras and the Armenian ones are to die for. Good selection of beer on tap and a homemade Arak option is available. Prices are incredible affordable while quality remains high! Highly recommended :-) they also have a small dance floor after 11."
Fabian Sck,5,"We absolutely loved the place. It was very busy when we arrived so make sure to book a table in advance.

We ordered the lamb and the chicken tagine. While the chicken tagine was a bit too sweet for my taste, my wife loved it. The lamb was delicious! And a lot of meat so come hungry. We both chose the cuscus as a side which was very good.

We sat at the bar and had a great conversation with waiters and barkeepers. Super friendly there.

Also live music was played."
yasar adanali,5,"The place has a split personality. Until midnight, it serves delicious food and nice cocktails with a cosy ambiance. Then music and increased level of alcohol in blood take control and people start dancing everywhere, including on top of tables :) Love it"
Lama N,5,Tried mezyan on thursday night while enjoying safi reslan and his amazing voice. We tried their : fattoush. Halloumi rocca . Mohammara . Hommos. Cheese rolls . Halloumi carrot and their famous black cumin potatos . Loved every single items but the most were mohammara and their black cumin potatos.
Eman MK,5,"All the food melts in your mouth, it's simply delicious! The ambiance is pretty cozy and friendly staff. I recommend!"
Rajaa Gacem van Moorsel,5,"While on holiday in Lebanon we have been recommended to go to Mezyan and it became our favorite place ! It was by far the place with the best food in Beirut, the best service ever and the vibes are incredible when they have live music ! The people working there are super nice, special  thanks to Yeran who went the extra mile and managed to find us a corner while the place was fully booked on my last day in Beirut. We really appreciated and it made our last night memorable! If you want to have the best time while in Beirut, I  would really recommend going to Mezyan !"
Zeinab Dirani,2,"The place by itself is nice and cozy. The menu is very limited and the chicken does not taste good. The mezza is acceptable but it can be better in terms of quality. The portions are big and the service is fast.
Recommended if you want a nice atmosphere but not really if you want delicious food. Price is good"
Mike Greenberg,5,I just had a lovely meal here. Definitely worth a visit!
Louay Ahmadieh,1,High Prices.
TMM,5,Armenian  cuisine never disappoints
LCM,5,"Mezyan, nestled in the heart of Beirut, offers an enchanting fusion of flavors that truly captivate the senses. From the moment you enter, the vibrant atmosphere and artistic decor transport you to a world where Lebanese and international cuisines effortlessly blend. The menu is a culinary kaleidoscope, featuring a diverse range of dishes that creatively combine traditional and contemporary elements. The mezza selection is a highlight, presenting a delightful array of small plates bursting with intricate tastes. The attentive service and live music elevate the dining experience, creating an ambiance perfect for both intimate dinners and lively gatherings. Mezyan is a must-visit for those in search of an innovative gastronomic adventure amidst the cultural tapestry of Beirut."
sarah dergham,5,"One of the best Atmosphere, food, service in Lebanon!! Staff are super friendly!"
Henry,5,"This place was delicious with great service. It was kind of tricky to find if you're using GPS, because the entry isnt very obvious."
Alper Demirel,5,It was a really pleasure for me to be in Mezyan. Atmosphere was really good. Especially the waiters were really kind. Yeran has really amazing energy and you can learn lots of things about the country and the culture. The foods are really delicious and so soft. You should visit...
Fabian Nguyen,5,Extraordinary food! Very delicious and highly recommended!
Lieke van Tooren,5,Great atmosphere and great food. Very nice waitress who recommended tasty options from the menu.
Georgia Leach,5,Delicious dinner and drinks with great atmosphere. Would certainly recommend this place for dinner in Hamar. We went on Thursday and they have live music.
Katie Horsfield,5,One of my favourite restaurants in Beirut. The food is wonderful. And they often have great local live music.
Narod Haroutunian,4,friendly waiters. Prices are cheap too.
J S,5,"Love the vibes of this place. The food is delicious, the music is always great, people are awesome. I love going here! Recommend to book on advance, and be ready for dim lights and dancing once 10:30pm comes around (on days with dj)"
Amine,5,"Good restaurant
They are lebanese and they serve moroccan food . I am moroccan and i found it delicious. And the waitress is so Nice"
Dana ‚ÄúD A N A‚Äù Amer,5,It always has been one of the coziest and most delicious restaurant in Beirut !
Georges Ishak,5,Everytime I find this place better than the previous. The food is really tasty and looks nice and delicious. There is a variety of items in the menu at reasonable prices and the staff is very welcoming. Recommended
Courine ER,5,"loved the food, the service and the whole vibe ! definitely a must go to spot!"
James G,4,Little bit expensive to be Lebanon. It was funny it was. Party meanwhile People was eating dinner. No a lot place to dance
Rui Duarte,5,Very nice place and marocain food very tasty
Sinead McEvoy,5,Great food and lively atmosphere
Uzul Migubas,5,"Good selection of lebanese mezza and both local and international beverages, including craft beer and wine. Small garden is available - few tables, place to smoke. Prices are not very low, but the place is nice and classy"
Zaynab Mourad,4,"Great place, fantastic music, but smoking indoor is the only downside of it."
Sebastian,5,Restaurant turns into an Arabic dance floor at night. So much fun and great vibes!! Cannot comment on the food.
George,1,Horrible bartenders who should not be working in customer service. I saw them lash out at 2 customers last night and the customers ended up leaving. The bartender (wearing piercings) made a scene and was very aggressive. very unprofessional.
Yara Abi Farraj,5,"Always amazing! Great atmosphere, amazing food. Great service. Mezyan is one of my go-to places in Hamra it is a must visit"
Natalia,5,"good food, portions too bigü•π"
has_mza,4,"Cozy place, booking is required , the food is tasty"
Jimmy NADER,5,"A truly joyful nightlife experience, with delicious Lebanese food in a middle-eastern vintage-kitch ambiance, and when after 11h pm the DJ kicks-in, the people start to party and dance until the late night. A highly recommended experience if you're either a visitor or a local.

(Note: I visited this place 2 years ago. Not sure about its status now after the pandemic and the economic crisis.)"
Patrick Chemali,5,Lovely place with a very rich menu allowing one to discover new dishes or come back for favorites. The service is very good and the prices are within range for this type of service
Daniel Aks,5,Absolutely loved both the food and the live Lebanese music. The ambiance of this place on one of these band nights is simply magical!
Francisco Meneses,4,Delicious food and ambience. Service still has a lot to improve tough...
Emilie Denis,5,"The food was great! Loved the atmosphere of the place , you should definitely go there for diner if you are in Beirut"
Joe Obeid,5,I simply love this place! My favorite restaurant in the area. They offer delicious authentic dishes that we just can't get enough of. Also their prices are very reasonable. The atmosphere is cosy and the staff make you feel very welcomed. Make sure to try the vegetarian couscous! Highly recommended!
Thomas Sutton,5,Couldn't recommend a Thursday night here highly enough! Great Lebanese band!! Arrive by 9.30 for a table. Food was outstanding - Lebanese/Algerian/Moroccan. Service impeccable. Great setting. Whole place up dancing by 11ish - what's not to like!! Do it
Ahmed Kamel,5,"Fast service, tasty finger licking food and the atmosphere was great üí´

Highly recommend for lebanese cuisine"
Kv Duong,5,This place is simply fantastic! I only wish the rest of Beirut was like this. Very tasty food with a wide menu of Lebanese/ Moroccan/ Armenian food (don't let this put you off. We went back 3 nights in a row and tried the majority of their menu). Low key efficient and friendly service. Great to see both locals and tourists here - ie a place that is actually priced for the locals as well!
Carolina Pompilio,5,"Love this place, especially with the live music and dancing people"
Mehlad,5,"The place is very cosy and original in it's interior design. The atmosphere is so relaxed and suitable for quality time with either yourself or with your pals; and it's even romantic given the dim lighting. Food and beverages are reasonably priced given the good quality and the portions, also the menu is diverse. The best part for me was how at 11 pm the place transforms from a restaurant into a night club. I recommend this place for anyone who's interested in Lebanon's nightlife!"
Philippe Elia,3,"A nice place im Hamra's Main street. Food is nicely served and is delicious. Service is good and staff are nice. The menu is really rich and interesting. Alcohol is also great.
At around midnight, the place ""transforms"" into a club. Music is weird yet very fun. Environment though becomes a little bit messy for a small place where tables become the dancing floor themselves."
Tiffany Darwish,5,One of my last meals in Beirut ... delish
Jad Abou Ibrahim,5,"What is there to say other than the place to unwind, enjoy good food, and good music."
safa,5,"One of Beirut's gems! Lebanese/Armenian/Moroccan cuisine. Great food, great prices, great atmosphere and super friendly staff. A wide variety of great vegan dishes to leave you completely satisfied. Doubles up as a bar and music venue, check out their live bands!"
Sogand A,4,Delicious food and inviting ambiance. 
T.Abdullatif,5,The best cocktails and appetizers I have ever had.
Z S,5,"Great place. Food is well priced within the market, Staff are very friendly, and atmosphere is excellent."
Ziad Zeytoun,4,"Very good traditional Lebanese food.
Not expensive, given its location in Hamra.
Personally I prefer the place to be more quiet, but other than that, everything is great.
Hosts live music, but I haven't attended any of their events yet.
Overall, I think Mezyan offers a good experience."
Mohamad Sabbah,5,Very fun place! It has interesting food. You should definitely try Itch and the Arak. On weekend nights the place turns into a party and during the day it's pretty calm. Must try place!
Charlotte PARIS,5,"Great setting (don't pay to much attention to the fact that you have to enter through a commercial lobby) Good cocktails - there are better ones in Beirut but usually in specialist bars so by that standard they are doing pretty well. The terrace outside is very nice, there is a good choice of dishes and everything we tried was very tasty. Service can be a bit long and forget a thing of two here and there but the place is very alive with a nice crowd and makes this one of the best spot in Hamra. Once to visit and visit again. I hear late at the weekend there is also some dancing there."
Paul Attenborough,5,"Casual dining with a local menu, and excellent too, both food and value, beer (I haven't tried anything else!), wine spirits. Happy hour after 5,an outside terrace for smokers, and no hookahs inside. Important to me as so many places in Beirut I cannot  breathe! Recommended if you are in Hamra!"
Naseem Ferdowsi,4,"Affordable prices, unique dishes, tasty food that won't disappoint and which is from different parts of the world including Armenia, Morocco, Lebanon and Greece. Environment is chill and bohemian. Servers are, for the most part, friendly ‚Ä¶"
Travel Kirkwood,5,"Must visit. Lovely food, fast, friendly service, good portions"
Klaus Burger,5,Prices for food and drinks are decent.
Kate Svitaylo,4,"Good food, nice interior, friendly staff. Quite democratic prices. Exist terras for smokers, and no smoking inside which is great. Not so easy to find the place, as ipts a bit inside of the building. Great menu with big variety of choices and prices."
Necrostate,3,"One of my favourite restaurants in Lebanon in terms of food. 3 stars for their indoor smoking policy which is a big deal breaker to me and many people I know. (Open indoor smoking as of 7-8 pm, as for the other times, people can smoke in the corners, which is not as bad, but still bad.. it's the same air.. smoking and food don't mix)"
Dolux,5,"Great food, both local (amazing fattoush) and international (veggie couscous was slot on). Very nice to unwind after a day of exploring the city, especially if you are staying near hamra. On the weekend it gets pretty crowded."
Douaa Kaaki,4,"I'd rate the food 3/5, not bad, but not awesome, but, the ambiance is great ! Loved the seating, it doesn't feel like you're on Hamra Main  street, and it's quite private and cozy."
Ramez Azzam,4,Very nice place. The food is good. Music is great. But gets boring since its repeated over and over weekend after weekend. The other problem is that when people start smoking inside at 11 it gets really nasty
Marwa Chehab,5,Amazing food and good service. Perfect for Friday night out with friends and dancing
Rami El Hachem,5,"Great service, great food"
Sami Mahroum,1,"Manager has the habit of rushing you out of your table to accommodate new customers...will make the claim table is booked.

Place attracts western expats so doesn't provide a good place to meet real locals."
sophia wakim,5,"Very nice place, excellent food and very affordable prices."
Ahmad Hachem,5,"One of the very few places that has consistent good food, can't go wrong with anything on the menu, reasonable prices, great quality and ambient"
Montaha Nattah,3,"Chill comfy place, but the food is not that delicious, except for their batata harra and Fattoush, which are super good!
On the weekends, from almost 11:30 pm till 2 am, there is music and people just dance and enjoy their time.
I recommend this place, if you are going out with someone for the first time."
Ali Daher,4,Good food. Great mood inside. 
erica b,2,"Really bad service. First they cheated us with happy hour drinks by telling us that there are 'exceptions' after we ordered drinks that according to the notice board, should be in happy hour price. We ordered lamb tagine and they gave us beef tagine. Two people recognised it as beef and the waiter was trying to convince us that it is lamb because they know their meat source.  Horrible. Never again."
Mood Bacho,4,"Great value and excellent food with generous portions, especially the vegetarian selections. You just have to have enough time to wait as it takes an inordinate amount of time to get something out of the kitchen and the sole waitress there is far from efficient or friendly."
Mohamed Mohsen,1,"People were very unfriendly and uninviting. The waiters kept refusing to offer us places to sit and reminding us of the extra fees for what they called ""entertainment band"" I would never recommend it to anyone."
Aya Refaat,4,"Mezyan is one of the nicest places in Hamra.

Food is great, specially ""mezzat"" like hot potato, itch and dolma. People are friendly, they help you to make a choice if you are confused about what to eat and drink.

Food quality is really good, prices are okay, as you all know lebanon is a very expensive country specially Beirut. This is a restaurant in one of the most famous streets of Beirut, so it can't be cheap, but honestly compared to other places, their prices are okay, you can pay btw 10$ to 15$ for a nice dinner and a beer (no meet).

They have both indoor and a small outdoor areas, but personally I prefer the terrace tables, as after 8pm the place gets so crowded specially during weekends.

The only drawback is that you have to be there before 8 pm, the best timing is between (5:30 pm to 7pm), as if you go later I can't guarantee you to find a table.
After 11 pm the place becomes overcrowded and noisy, people get drunk and start dancing and singing out loudly, which I don't like and I find so annoying, but if you like partying, you would love the place."
Tariq Keblaoui,2,"Going to start off by saying most people like this place, but every time I've come here I get the same experience.

Being glared at by the man in the fedora hat who owns the place (with an instance of him refusing me a table once while the place was empty for no explained reason) and the classic and consistent food poisoning every-time I order a tabouleh/fattoush or sausage."
Noura Ab-am,5, I come here every time I'm hungry and broke only to be shooed away after creeping around the premises in hopes of someone tossing me some food. 100% would recommend.
Michal Krƒç√°l,5,"Great Moroccan food with reasonable prices and big portions. Add really friendly, helpfull and advisable staff and you will have one of the most tasteful experience in Beirut."
Omar Kabbani,5,"Been coming here for 5 days straight. I sampled everything on the menu. It's a hip RestauBar with friendly service and delicious food inspired by north African, Aleppan and Armenian influences. It's also an assembly point of Beiruts hot and rising creators."
zeina awedikian,5,"Amazing place, Thursday is the best night with live music, good music, dancing, and food is super good. Great for dates or groups. We visit every time we go to Lebanon"
Fahed AL Riachi,5,"One of the best places to eat in beirut, prices are moderate and well thought. At night there is always a kind of activity, whether live music, a theatrical play or a DJ, where the place becomes an open dance floor!"
Gerard Kohl,5,"Good vegan food, populair spot. A bit difficult to find (it's inside a building)"
rima issa,5,A hidden gem in Hamra street. A must try
Rami Cortas,5,Nice local food and drinks for a fair price. The band performed the most authentic lebanese songs which created a great atmosphere. Reservation is a must.
Sherine ElZein,5,"Mediterranean fusion restaurant nested on one of Hamra's alleyways. Love their eggplant fatteh, it is to die for ! Everything on the menu is good and the ambience is genuinely fun ! It is not a posh/showy spot, it is more on the neo leftist side of things, just like the Hamra neighbourhood used to be and it is what I love about this place. It managed to keep this cache in and the shallow society out."
PGV,4,Very nice!!!
Carol Ezzeddine,5,"This place is super nice! Both the ambiance and all the food were great, and even the prices were cheap. Would recommend to everyone!"
Stephanie C,3,"Prices are very low compared to usual market price. Ingredients' quality was good, but, unfortunately, the lemon chicken tagine I took lacked of taste. Maybe worth trying lebanese dishes instead."
Owen McGrath,4,"A modern, casual restaurant, serving a wide variety of tasty Lebanese and international dishes in a lively, pleasant atmosphere. Good value. Friendly and efficient staff."
HOUSSAM ALAHMDAIA,1,"Very Bad Attitude from the Manager, "
√âric Didelon,1,"The food is good, alright. But there were only two or three customers the day I went there and the waitresses were way too busy checking their text messages to attend their customers. Gross"
UmmAali 1978,4,"A good restaurant. Nothing special about the interior. It offers good lebanese mezza. I ordered mtabal koussa, fattouch, humus, batata harra. It tastes yummy. The vegeterian koskos is super. Its a must try. Loved the morrocan tea with mint. Its so refreshing. Excellent service and fair prices"
Fletcher Gull,5,"Mezyan has a Good mood and offers really delicious food that are their own take on known Lebanese and Syrian recipes ...
As a vegan, there are many options for me to choose from, like any other Oriental/Lebanese restaurant...
The music is interesting....
The team is ok, but could do better...
But all in all, it's a recommended place for someone looking for Oriental/Lebanese food in the capital!"
Hyun Jung Lee,5,Great Lebanese fare in Hamra; has outdoor covered sitting too (I loved that I could take my little furry). 5-8 happy hour 50% off drinks. Ask for the daily dish.
G√∂tz Karphofer,5,"Delicious Maroccan-Lebanese fusion cuisine plus a very good selection of local Lebanese wines. Life concerts on weekends, local and international customers, fairly priced"
Naim Zard,5,"Ordered wine on a Sunday evening, place was crowded, order got delayed. They offered them for free. Staff is also super friendly and place is casual and nice. Highly recommended."
sergio koliana,5,"The fattouch at Mezyan is a must! This place feels like home; good food and friendly staff. Reasonable prices for a place to chill before 11 pm and party afterwards. Needs reservation sometimes, especially on weekends."
Fabietto,5,"Great place. Great music, great stuff, great food, nice people: Beirut!"
lisa dillman,5,"I was only in Beirut for three days, and would happily have spent a month simply eating at different places, but Mezyan was a favorite. We arrived late and it was clear they were about to close, but let us hang out and have a couple glasses of wine. The carrot, halloumi warm mezza with whole coriander seeds was amazing. Since returning home I've been trying to recreate it (unsuccessfully). If and when I can get back to Beirut, I'll eat there a lot!"
Karim Dernaika,5,"One of the best restaurants in Hamra and definitely is the best value for money. Delicious original Lebanese/Armenian/Moroccan platers. You should not miss trying the Baba Ghanouj, it's to die for."
Georges Elias,5,"Very nice restaurant where u can eat tasty dishes , we ordered fattoush , beetroot salad , olive salad , batata Harra and the batenjein in oven , they were all delicious , nothing to complain about .
We always come here with friends, we eat then we dance the night on nice music"
Ibrahim D. Bahati,4,Lovely and quiet cheap place to taste some Lebanese traditional dishes. The staff is also nice.  However its crowded in the evenings
Jamal Fattouh,5,Great Middle Eastern and North African Fusion food. Great ambiance. And the best is there's a non smoking section in the Middle of Beirut
Abeer Haddad,5,I love this place! Especially on Thursday night where there is a live band. The service can sometimes be slow but it's ok because the food is good and the ambience is nice
Tim Windle,4,"Great food, great price, great vibe. The only things denying it that fifth star is that our order was slightly messed up and the pint of beer isn't quite a pint."
Guide,4,"A nice and cozy restaurant in Hamra
Delicious food from different cuisines and beautiful ambiance with very reasonable prices
Friendly and cooperative staff
You usually need reservation especially at night
A terrace is available for smokers
Music night is great
Recommeded"
Hassan Sa.,5,"Good food, good service, chill ambiance, well located. Fun puzzle to find the entrance )"
Nicolas Dahan,4,"Good food, generous portions. "
Nazih Fares,5,"A great hip place with amazing North African, Lebanese and Armenian fusion food. The live bands range from electronic and alternative experimental bands to traditional Arabic tarab."
Movement Medicine,4,"We were two people and we chose to have the daily dish which was amazing on the side of some Fattoush which is a Lebanese salad and the heavenly Baked Fetta

We were very pleased with the taste and portions of all the food and I think we had more than enough to eat

We only paid 10 USD per person which was also really good"
Sleepy Snoopy,4,Great food and funky vibe with a nice mixed crowd. The best part is when the whole place starts dancing after midnight. Everywhere!!
jessica kozah,5,A great place to visit. It have it all from delicious food to great music nice and cosy decoration and friendly stuff ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è t deserve more than 5 stars üåü ‚Ä¶

Abe A,5,"They have a wide vegetarian selection, try the vegetarian daily dish or the zucchini gratin"
Reine Abi Rached,5,Really liked the MOUSAKHAN CHICKEN ROLLS.
Zeynep T√ºz√ºn,5,"We chose to go to this place for 2 of the 3 nights we stayed in Beirut. We felt at home thanks to the lady named Yeran (I hope I spelled her name correctly) who took care of us. Batata hara, eggplant fatte, Armenian stuffed meatballs (kƒ±bbe), taboule (sallata with lots of greenery) were all delicious. Definitely recommended. It was also nice to come across the DJ performance on Friday and Saturday. We had our fill of local music."
Deniz Miray A.,5,"You should definitely come to Beirut and eat at Mezyan! üòç We had lunch at Mezyan, as I read a lot in blogs and recommended by a friend from Beirut. If I were to list all the restaurants I've tried in Beirut, Mezyan would definitely be at the top üëçüèº

üëâüèºHummus: It was definitely the best hummus I had in Beirut. Of course 10/10.
üëâüèºKibbe: The stuffed meatballs were very successful. 10/10
üëâüèºTahina Chicken: Tahini chicken dish - I didn't think tahini sauce could go so well with chicken, it was very successful. 9/10
üëâüèºBatata Harra: The potatoes were cooked in a slightly spicy sauce - it was amazing. 10/10

ü§ìWe also liked that it was quiet at lunch. By the way, when you look for Mezyan on the street, you do not come across him directly, you enter through the passage.
üé∂My friend from Beirut also said that there is musical entertainment in the evenings on weekends, we did not attend but it was very entertaining."
Carine Lahoud,5,"The experience was beyond my expectations
Cool and cozy place with Arabic live music band I have danced all night long it was a night to remember with my beautiful friends we wear like 9 people its almost 30$ per person food and drinks
The electricity goes off and we continue singing and the electricity comes on and the singer continues with the rhythm with Carla and Tony ü§£ü§£
You have to try this place I really recommend"
Fatma Nese Kok,5,"It is better to go by making a reservation, the food is good, the place is nice. Two dishes were particularly good, one was Makdous, made with pickled eggplant. It may not appeal to everyone, for those who like things like fried pickles. Barkouk tagine, lamb with prunes, was delicious. A very sweet lady who spoke Turkish looked after our table and helped us choose. It is at the bottom of a place like a passage, we would never have found it ourselves by wandering around the street if our guide had not guided us. I recommend it to everyone."
Justyna,5,"Very tasty food, the place is a bit hidden, but has its own charm. The only thing I didn't like was the squid - it looked like something from a Lidl package, but the interior was very nice, so I don't detract from the rating."
tahsin akpƒ±nar,5,"We liked it very much. Raki glasses are as big as lemonade glasses. The appetizers have the same/similar names as ours, but they taste amazing!! The waiters are very friendly and positive. There is even a friend who speaks Turkish. I definitely recommend it."
Josip Broz Tito,5,"An Armenian waitress took care of us. He spoke Turkish very well. We ordered 5 pieces of appetizers, but we couldn't finish them. I didn't have the chance to try kunefe. The portions of the food are large and delicious. We ordered sausage, stuffed meatballs, hummus, potato batata harra and salad. A glass of raki, a glass of wine. It cost around $35. I think it's a normal number. Only the entrance is in a passage. Those who go there need to be a little careful. I found it by searching privately. Otherwise you won't find it."
Stefano Ungherini,5,We had dinner at this very nice place. The food was very good and the prices were certainly in line with our local ones
Malak Chami,5,"Truly the best experience where I felt at home, it tasted like my mother's and grandmother's food that has been made with love."
Adolfo,5,"Armenian restaurant in the heart of Hamra in Beirut. The place is very nice and the dishes are delicious. Personally, I recommend taking various tastings of the so-called mezza, i.e. small tastings. This way you can try many different flavors. The baba ganousche is excellent"
Adnan Altaleb,5,"A special place for gatherings of friends, parties and dancing
Its prices are reasonable and the service is very good. It is a place that makes you feel happy, joyful and enjoyable. Its location is special. Saturday evening is special and its concerts are varied between Arabic and foreign. It presents bands and singers with beautiful voices and they create a fun atmosphere."
helen bevernage,5,"Fantastic experience for our first evening in Beirut! The food was delicious and fresh, with an extensive menu. The service is very warm, smooth and friendly. They helped us with tips for Beirut and the exchange rate. The atmosphere was cozy, the food even better!"
Pascal LANNOO,5,One of the best addresses in Hamra! When you have the chance to be on the terrace the atmosphere is great. We eat really well there and they make homemade bread.
Isabelle Jourdan,5,"Tasty and generous cuisine in a very warm and friendly setting. Relaxed atmosphere and a smiling and cordial welcome which allowed us to discover delicious Armenian cuisine at very affordable prices. A very small downside: the noise level of conversations quickly becomes overwhelming. But a real plus, no hookah smoke, but perfect value for money. We will return there by sitting on the pretty little terrace at the back to enjoy the peace and quiet. To recommend without hesitation, which is rare in Beirut at the moment"
Sophie Perrin,5,"Very good traditional food with a thousand and one flavors.
Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious"
Lorenzo Balbo,4,A place located along a corridor overlooking Hamra Street. A little crowded and noisy but with excellent food and fast service. More than affordable prices confirm the right choice! To try
FahD Almutairi,5,"The food is very excellent, clean and furnished. Chicken in lemon. Great, I recommend the food is great and it is a large and comfortable restaurant"
N. Samer,3,"A restaurant with acceptable taste, but with few samples, and the price is above average"
Noor Ali,5,"A very great place, the food is delicious, the service is excellent, the owner of the restaurant is very respectful and helpful, their drinks are amazing, and the music is amazing."
V,4,"together with t-marbouta, which is practically next to it, it is one of the most typical, accessible, welcoming and satisfying restaurants in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. the staff is more than friendly, and the menu satisfactory. it is certainly worth spending the evening there during aperitif-dinner time."
Geo Pass,3,Good food but high prices. I paid 22 euros for a veal dish. The shop does not have a price list
Duygu Uzunoƒülu,2,"The food and appetizers are definitely not delicious. The service is very bad. We went to eat, we asked for room for two people, they wanted to sit one on a coffee table the size of a tiny serving plate. When we asked how we would eat here, we got the answer that everyone eats here. They have positioned themselves as a place for intellectuals, and they charge undeserved prices just for the ambiance (since expats go there). Stuffed vine leaves and hummus taste bad enough to make you think they came from cans."
Sandy Lourida,5,"Nice atmosphere, authentic Lebanese food. The restaurant is located in a small corner in Hamra. An expatriate friend in Beirut introduced me to it and since then I have visited quite often. I recommend this restaurant!"
Saif Wady,1,"Nice place, very good food. My vote is linked to the unjustified refusal to accept the $100 bill that we paid, we were treated by thieves who present fake money, for a self-respecting establishment a pen or a machine was enough to verify the banknote rather than doing and having it done the demmerda figure in front of everyone. Terrible I will never go back again!"
Sulaiman ALShamri,4,The reception was excellent. It is a Moroccan restaurant for lovers of Moroccan food. People will like the restaurant very much
Mukhtar Shehata,5,"The greatest experience in Hamra, and all of Lebanon... Excellent beer and also after 9pm smoking is allowed in the main hall... Great"

Service can be a bit long and forget a thing of two here and there but the place is very alive with a pleasant crowd and makes this one of the top spot in Hamra. Once to visit and visit again.

Mario Ramadan,5,"You should definitely come to Beirut and eat at Mezyan! üòç We had lunch at Mezyan, as I read a lot in blogs and recommended by a friend from Beirut. If I were to list all the restaurants I've tried in Beirut, Mezyan would definitely be at the top üëçüèº

üëâüèºHummus: It was definitely the top hummus I had in Beirut. Of course 10/10.
üëâüèºKibbe: The stuffed meatballs were very successful. 10/10
üëâüèºTahina Chicken: Tahini chicken dish - I didn't think tahini sauce could go so well with chicken, it was very successful. 9/10
üëâüèºBatata Harra: The potatoes were cooked in a slightly spicy sauce - it was incredible. 10/10

ü§ìWe also liked that it was quiet at lunch. By the way, when you look for Mezyan on the street, you do not come across him directly, you enter through the passage.
üé∂My friend from Beirut also said that there is musical entertainment in the evenings on weekends, we did not attend but it was very entertaining."
Eli Maksoudian (Eli),5,One of my fav places

The waiters are so helpful and discrete. We were welcomed by a bread basket and a cup of debs remman as we requested!
We ordered:
-their exquisite fattoush: not to be missed with the tastiest dressing
- The Zaalouk: our all time addiction. for those who never tired it, a must: it is a Moroccan mezza of eggplants, pepper and tomatoes flawlessly blended
- Chicken and lemon tajine with a side of couscous: with lots of caramelized onions and scrumptious Moroccan seasoning

If you have not visited them yet you should!

One of  my previous experiences is detailed below

We arrived late and it was clear they were about to close, but let us hang out and have a couple glasses of wine. The carrot, halloumi warm mezza with whole coriander seeds was truly exceptional.

zeina sabbagh,5,"Mezyan is one of the delightfulst places in Hamra.

Food is exceedingly good quality, specially ""mezzat"" like hot potato, itch and dolma. People are friendly, they help you to make a choice if you are confused about what to eat and drink.

Food quality is really good quality, prices are okay, as you all know lebanon is a very expensive country specially Beirut. This is a restaurant in one of the most famous streets of Beirut, so it can't be cheap, but honestly compared to other places, their prices are okay, you can pay btw 10$ to 15$ for a delightful dinner and a beer (no meet).

They have both indoor and a small outdoor areas, but personally I prefer the terrace tables, as after 8pm the place gets so crowded specially during weekends.

The only drawback is that you have to be there before 8 pm, the unmatched timing is between (5:30 pm to 7pm), as if you go later I can't guarantee you to find a table.
After 11 pm the place becomes overcrowded and noisy, people get drunk and start dancing and singing out loudly, which I don't like and I find so annoying, but if you like partying, you would love the place."
Nadine Aub,5,"Delicious cuisine. Pleasant place. Relaxed ambiance, quality customer service.
To suggest without hesitation"
Georges Frangieh,5,"Mezyan has a Good mood and offers really exceptionally delectable food that are their own take on known Lebanese and Syrian recipes ...
As a vegan, there are many options for me to choose from, like any other Oriental/Lebanese restaurant...
The music is interesting....
The team is ok, but could do better...
But all in all, it's a suggested place for someone looking for Oriental/Lebanese food in the capital!"

We ordered the lamb and the chicken tagine. While the chicken tagine was a bit too sweet for my taste, my wife adored it. The lamb was exceptionally delectable! And a lot of meat so come hungry. We both chose the cuscus as a side which was very good quality.

We sat at the bar and had a exceedingly good quality conversation with waiters and barkeepers. Super friendly there.

Mahmoud Dirani,2,Worst food i have ever eaten. Waitresses are helping you to choose worst dishes only. Cherry kebap is the worst thing i have ever eaten. I don't advice this restaurant.
marwa elmasry,2,"The place by itself is delightful and snug. The menu is very limited and the chicken does not taste good quality. The mezza is acceptable but it can be better in terms of quality. The portions are big and the customer service is fast.

Ramzy Abourialy,1,Very High Prices.
Khaled Ibrahim,1,Horrible bartenders who should not be working in customer customer service. I saw them lash out at 2 customers last night and the customers ended up leaving. The bartender (wearing piercings) made a scene and was very aggressive. very unprofessional.
moustafa kassir,1,"Manager has the habit of rushing you out of your table to accommodate new customers...will make the claim table is booked.

Place attracts western expats so doesn't provide a good quality place to meet real locals."
Elizabeth Jones,1,"Really bad customer service. First they cheated us with happy hour drinks by telling us that there are 'exceptions' after we ordered drinks that according to the notice board, should be in happy hour price. We ordered lamb tagine and they gave us beef tagine. Two people recognised it as beef and the waiter was trying to convince us that it is lamb because they know their meat source.  Horrible. Never again."
Reem Reslan,2,"People were very unfriendly and uninviting. The waiters kept refusing to offer us places to sit and reminding us of the extra fees for what they called ""entertainment band"" I would never suggest it to anyone."
Ralph Malak,2,"Going to start off by saying most people like this place, but every time I've come here I get the same encounter.

Being glared at by the man in the fedora hat who owns the place (with an instance of him refusing me a table once while the place was empty for no explained reason) and the classic and consistent food poisoning every-time I order a tabouleh/fattoush or sausage."
Wissam Khoury,2,"Very Bad Attitude from the Manager, Very Loud Music"
Marie Tomb,1,"The food is good quality, alright. But there were only two or three customers the day I went there and the waitresses were way too busy checking their text messages to attend their customers. Gross"

Assem Khamis,2,"The food and appetizers are definitely not exceptionally delectable. The customer service is very bad. We went to eat, we asked for room for two people, they wanted to sit one on a coffee table the size of a tiny serving plate. When we asked how we would eat here, we got the answer that everyone eats here. They have positioned themselves as a place for intellectuals, and they charge undeserved prices just for the ambiance (since expats go there). Stuffed vine leaves and hummus taste bad enough to make you think they came from cans."
Wael Alyahia,1,"Nice place, very good quality food. My vote is linked to the unjustified refusal to accept the $100 bill that we paid, we were treated by thieves who present fake money, for a self-respecting establishment a pen or a machine was enough to verify the banknote rather than doing and having it done the demmerda figure in front of everyone. Terrible I will never go back again!"
